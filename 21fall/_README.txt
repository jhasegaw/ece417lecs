Standardize notation:

x for observations, y for labels, z for latent variables

xi for excitation, h for activation?

capital letters for RV.  Small letter for instance, except that matrices are capital.

N_X for cardinality of RV X, if X is integer.  N_Q, N_Y, N_K.

|A| for determinant of A.

Superscript for layers is clumsy; is it any better to make it a first subscript?

Commas between subscripts

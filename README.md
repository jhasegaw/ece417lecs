# ece417lecs

This repository contains the lecture slides for the University of Illinois course ECE 417 (Multimedia Signal Processing).  

Different lectures may be created in different ways, but the most common format is:

* A LaTeX file containing the slides for that lecture
* A python script to generate the figures
* A Makefile that downloads figures from the web, runs the python file, then compiles the LaTeX

Describe Viola-Jones in three steps:

1. Haar-like features
2. Finding the best threshold for a Haarlike features
3. Weighted combination of step-thresholded Haarlike features

For step 2, the best threshold, don't introduce signed error or
weights until they are useful to the proof.

1. The best threshold must be one of the feature values, so sort them in ascending order.
2. For sign=+1, you can find P(TP) by giving each token a weight, and adding w*y for f<threshold
3. Adding w*(1-y) gives P(FP)
4. Therefore error is P1- sum(w*(2y-1))
5. If sign=-1, adding w*y gives P(FN), while w*(1-y) gives P(TN), so error is P0+sum(w*(2y-1))
6. Compute signed weighted error, then argsort, then cumsum, then find min and max

Introduce weights at step 2.  Introduce signed weighted error at step 6.

Lectures 1 and 2: Don't teach eigenvectors and SVD.  Instead,
basically, teach what is currently the content of HW1, and make the HW
a set of sample problems instead.  Include: (1) derivative of scalar
w.r.t. vector (gradient) and w.r.t. matrix (which has dimensions equal
to transpose of the matrix), (2) orthogonal projection onto a vector,
onto an orthogonal basis, and onto a non-orthogonal frame, (3)
pseudo-inverse.  Include the formal definition A=AA^\dagA,
A^\dag=A^\dagAA^\dag, and the relationship to orthogonal projection,
and the algebraic forms for the short-fat and tall-thin matrices.

Bring back the vector sign on top of vectors.  Right now, y_1 is
sometimes the first element in the y vector, and sometimes the first
corner of the Y triangle.  If the distinction between scalar, vector,
and matrix is important, and known, then it's better to communicate
it.
